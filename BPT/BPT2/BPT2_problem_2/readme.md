Write a shell script in `script.sh` that checks if either the `global_config` or `local_config` directories exist, and if either of them do, then create an empty file named `default_config` in current working directory.

**Hint**

 - Use the concepts taught in Week 3 in Redirections and Combining Commands.
 - Make appropriate use of || and && operators.
